Battleship Game
Welcome to our implementation of the classic Battleship game, created as part of our final project for the Web Development course. This interactive game is designed for two players and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows players to place ships, launch missiles, and attempt to sink their opponent's fleet.
Features
Dynamic Ship Placement: Players can drag and drop ships onto their game board at the start of the game.
Missile Launching: Once all ships are placed, players can drag missiles to target and hit the opponent’s ships.
Responsive Game Status: The game updates players about whose turn it is and the game status dynamically.
Endgame Detection: The game detects when all ships are sunk or all missiles are used, declares a winner, or ends in a tie.
How to Play
Start the Game: Load the index.html in your browser to start the game.
Place Your Ships: Drag and drop your ships (Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser) onto your grid. Ships must be placed horizontally and cannot overlap or extend beyond the grid.
Launch Missiles: After placement, use your missiles to target the opponent's grid. Drag and drop missiles onto the opponent’s grid.
Switch Turns: The game automatically switches turns between players after each set of missile launches or when a player finishes placing their ships.
Check for Winner: The game declares a winner based on who has the most hits after all missiles are used or if all opponent's ships are sunk.
